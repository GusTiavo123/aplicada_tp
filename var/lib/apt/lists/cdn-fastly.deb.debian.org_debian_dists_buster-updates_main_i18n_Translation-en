 NX is a software suite which implements very efficient
 compression of the X11 protocol. This increases performance when
 using X applications over a network, especially a slow one.
 .
 nxagent is a nested Xserver providing NX transport of X sessions. The
 application is based on the well known Xnest "nested" server. nxagent,
 like Xnest, is an X server for its own clients, and at the same time, an
 X client for a system's local X server.
 .
 The main scope of nxagent is to eliminate X round-trips or transform
 them into asynchronous replies. nxagent works together with nxproxy.
 nxproxy itself does not make any effort to minimize round-trips
 by itself, this is demanded of nxagent.
 .
 Being an X server, nxagent is able to resolve all the property/atoms related
 requests locally, ensuring that the most common source of round-trips are
 nearly reduced to zero.

 such as mobile devices or computers behind restrictive firewalls.
 PageKite works around NAT, firewalls and IP-address limitations by
 using a combination of  tunnels and reverse proxies.
 .
 Natively supported protocols: HTTP, HTTPS
 Partially supported protocols: IRC, Finger
 .
 Any other TCP-based service, including SSH and VNC, may be exposed
 as well to clients supporting HTTP Proxies.

Description-en: Description: Secure Boot chain-loading bootloader - **NOT** signed
 This package provides a minimalist boot loader which allows verifying
 signatures of other UEFI binaries against either the Secure Boot DB/DBX or
 against a built-in signature database.  Its purpose is to allow a small,
 infrequently-changing binary to be signed by the UEFI CA, while allowing
 an OS distributor to revision their main bootloader independently of the CA.
 .
 NOTICE: This package used to contain the version of the bootloader
 binary signed by the Microsoft UEFI CA, but significant toolchain
 problems on arm64 have made it impossible to reliably build a safe
 arm64 shim for now. See
 https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot#arm64_problems for more
 information. In the hope that we can resolve these problems soon, for
 now this package instead contains another copy of the *unsigned* shim
 on arm64 to maintain package dependencies.

Description-en: time zone and daylight-saving time data
 This package contains data required for the implementation of
 standard local time for many representative locations around the
 globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by
 political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and
 daylight-saving rules.
